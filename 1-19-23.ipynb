       " 'In order to address issues of flow management at a regional scale, this project has focused on defining and quantifying the ecological processes necessary to maintain intact aquatic ecosystems in streams ranging from small headwaters watersheds to large rivers. We have adapted the ELOHA framework in pursuit of recommendations for statewide management of river and stream flows that avoid “cumulative adverse impacts” (in the words of the Great Lakes Compact) to water-dependent natural resources.\\nWe began by identifying six guilds of fish and four guilds of mussels and aquatic insects, comprising a total of 43 species, whose fluvial dependencies are clear and well-documented. We selected these species as target organisms to represent all aquatic organisms and communities. Next, we defined components of the flow regime that would facilitate discussion of the flow needs of the target organisms and of the management steps necessary to meet these needs. We have been guided in the identification of these flow components – which include various degrees of high, seasonal, and low flows, and the statistics that define them – by considerable previous work, including flow recommendations for the Susquehanna Basin (Dephilip and Moberg 2011), the Ohio River watershed in Pennsylvania (DePhilip and Moberg 2013), and the basic discussion of flow components by Mathews and Richter (2007).\\nDocumentation of the associations between the critical life stages of the target organisms and particular flow components (sections 4 and 5, and Appendix 2) enabled the Technical Advisory Team to frame hypotheses of how these organisms (and the wider aquatic ecosystems they represent) will respond to altered flow regimes. Framing and evaluating these hypotheses enabled us to match the reproductive success of target organisms with variations in flow components and to provide the scientific basis for the flow recommendations in the preceding section.\\nTo evaluate the hypotheses of response to flow alteration, we employed causal-criteria analysis of the scientific literature, a structured approach for assessing the support a given study provides to a particular hypothesis. The use of this method, in place of quantitative testing of hypotheses, is an interim step made necessary by the lack of region-wide hydrologic simulations of unaltered flows and by limited streamflow gage data. We grouped hypotheses that address similar reproductive phases or flow components into generalized flow needs so that our flow recommendations efficiently address ecological processes that affect many different species simultaneously.\\nThese steps, guided by the Technical Advisory Team and the experience of similar projects, have led to the flow recommendations presented in Section 6. These recommendations address a dual need – to safeguard low flows, particularly during the drier periods of the year, and to preserve the elements of hydrologic variability above these low flows that are essential for reproduction and other life cycles needs of the diverse array of organisms that characterize aquatic ecosystems. To address the dual need, we recommend the use of two policy tools: passby flows for protection of low flows, and withdrawal limits to preserve the essential elements of hydrologic variability. The analyses in section 6 demonstrate that each tool is necessary but not sufficient by itself to preserve flow-dependent natural resources. We have taken the further step of testing the impact of these recommendations on a range of typical withdrawals in four streams representing the four stream size classes. The two policy tools acting in combination result in flow regimes that meet our flow recommendations, and thereby meet the documented flow needs of aquatic ecosystems.\\nThis project has assembled considerable information about the life cycles of the target fish, mussels, and aquatic macroinvertebrates. The information provided in Section 4 and Appendix 2, when combined with equivalent documentation assembled in the Susquehanna and Ohio River projects, constitutes a useful database for other states or large watersheds in the Northeastern U.S. or Great Lakes Basin, since many of the species are common to both of these regions.\\nThis project has shared with the Ohio River study (DePhilip and Moberg 2013) the same methodology to frame and evaluate hypotheses of response to flow alteration and to aggregate these hypotheses into flow needs. These flow needs, and the documented evaluation of their constituent hypotheses, provide a framework with broad applicability for flow management in the Northeast and Great Lakes.\\nWe have attempted in this report to frame flow recommendations that are science-based and also practical to apply in an actual water regulatory program. The flow recommendations employ hydrologic statistics that can readily be computed for each stream or stream reach, given information on simulated unaltered flows and current water withdrawals. At the moment, such information is only available for the Pennsylvanian portion of the project study area. Full application of the recommendations, within the Great Lakes and throughout New York State, will be achievable with the Streamflow Estimator Tool (SET), now nearing completion by the USGS Water Sciences Center in Troy. The SET will simulate the unaltered hydrograph for each stream in New York State, providing agency staff with desktop access to the flow management statistics used in this report. We believe this new tool, and the recommendations in this report, provide the basis for a water regulatory program that is science-based, transparent, and protective of aquatic ecosystems.',\n",

       "array(['Development of recommended flow targets to support biological integrity based on regional flow-ecology relationships for benthic macroinvertebrates in Southern California streams',\n",
       "       'EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Changes to instream flow are known to be one of the major factors that affect the health of biological communities. Regulatory, monitoring, and management programs are increasingly using biological community composition, particularly benthic invertebrates, as one measure of instream conditions, stormwater project performance, or regulatory compliance with NPDES or other requirements and regulations. Understanding the relationship between changes in flow and changes in benthic invertebrate communities is, therefore, critical to informing decisions about ecosystem vulnerability, causes of stream and watershed degradation, and priorities for future watershed management. There are many approaches to developing flow-ecology relationships that relate hydrologic change to responses in instream biological communities that can be used to establish management targets. The Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) framework (Poff et al. 2010) provides a way to assess the effect of flow alteration on the condition of biological communities (vs. individual taxa) on a regional basis. Consequently, it is a useful approach for setting targets across a wide range of geographies and stream types where comprehensive detailed site-specific investigations are not practical. The framework includes elements of stream classification, estimation of flow alteration and development of flow ecology relationships based on the response of biological communities to changes in flow. In this project, we applied to the ELOHA framework to develop regional flow-ecology relationships and targets based on responses in the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Our objectives were: 1) Develop a recommended set of flow targets for southern California streams that would maximize the likelihood of maintaining healthy biological communities as indicated by the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) for benthic invertebrates. 2) Produce a set of tools that can be readily applied to future sites to estimate hydrologic alteration relative to biologically-define targets. Development of the regional flow-ecology relationships relied on an ensemble of hydrologic models to estimate flow alteration at ungauged sites, and took advantage of a regional bioassessment data that allowed us to assess flow-ecology relationships at broad spatial scales. Our general approach involved developing a hydrologic classification for the entire State of California, calibrating and validating watershed models for the stream classes present in southern California, using the models to assess hydrologic change at 572 bioassessment sites, relating hydrologic change to biological responses, setting targets based on likelihood of biological response associated with changes in key flow metrics, applying the flow-ecology tools to assess regional hydrologic condition, and prioritizing sites for various management actions based on their response relative to the established flow targets (along with information on presence of other stressors; Figure ES-1). Hydrologic Classification Application of the ELOHA framework begins with stream classification. This is particularly important in places like California which have extreme climatic, altitudinal, and geologic gradients which affect stream morphology, flow patterns, and biological communities. This complexity, combined with spatially variable patterns of land use (e.g. urban, agricultural, timber, hydropower) produces highly variable flow responses in streams that must be accounted for during development of flow management targets. We developed a statewide classification system using a two-step approach: First, we classified stream reaches according to watershed characteristics. Streams were clustered into 7 classes based on differences in winter precipitation, geology, soil characteristics, and mean watershed elevation (Figure ES-2). Second, we used flow data from a subset of streams with gauge information to test and refine the stream classes and determine which hydrologic variables best separate streams into their respective classes. Most of the hydrologic variables that best discriminated between-stream typology classes were indicative of high flows, mean or median flows, or flow timing. Assessing Hydrologic Alteration We modeled hydrologic alteration at 572 ungauged bioassessment sites in Southern California using a two-step approach. First, we developed an ensemble of 26 calibrated and validated watershed models applicable to all 572 sites. One of the 26 models was assigned to each of the 572 ungauged sites based on similarities in catchment properties. Second, we used the models to generate hourly flows for both current and reference conditions at each site and used the flow data to calculate a suite of flow metrics that represent different hydrograph components (e.g. magnitude, duration, frequency). Reference conditions were simulated by adjusting the current models to reflect pre-urbanization conditions by setting imperviousness to zero to mimic no urban land use, and by increasing initial losses to account for greater land availability. Using a suite of over 100 flow metrics, we estimate that approximately 79% of the region shows some degree of hydrologic alteration, and approximately 40% of the sites can be considered severely altered with at least 10 metrics exhibiting severe hydrologic alteration. Among the five metric categories (timing, frequency, magnitude, duration and variability), the most common alteration was an augmentation of the magnitude metrics. In general, hydrologic alteration is pervasive in catchments with total impervious cover higher than 2% (Figure ES-3). By applying a regionally applicable ensemble of hydrologic models to a large bioassessment data set, we were able to model biological responses across a wide range of range of conditions, and derive flow targets that can be applied to sites throughout the region. Furthermore, because these targets are based on probabilities of biologic response to varying degrees of hydrologic alteration (vs. static targets) managers can adjust the targets according to their tolerance for risk or based on the importance of competing water demands. Development of regionally applicable flow targets allows application to any bioassessment site and reduces the need to develop local flowecology relationships for every stream of interest, as is the case in more traditional instream flow methods. This provides a mechanism for prioritizing management actions based on consistent flow-ecology relationships. The tools developed through this project are readily transferable for local stakeholders to produce measures of hydrologic change for any location of interest, and to explore how those values would change under different land-use or management scenarios.',\n",
